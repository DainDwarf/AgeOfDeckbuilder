# Board

A shrinking list whose goal is zero. One line per item; **priority is order; completion is deletion.** A line reaches this file only through `/todo`, on the user's order, as a title and one sentence; a passing thought goes to [`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) instead. `/intake` then settles the line's design with the user and gives it a done-condition, machine-verifiable where possible, its doc-impact, and a dossier `board/<slug>.md` holding its contract — spec, scope, traps, plan — written once, on the settled state, and deleted with the line. A line with a dossier link is ready to ship; one without waits for intake. A line that cannot be completed is documentation — it moves to `docs/`.

Before intake: `- **Title** — what it is about.` After intake: `- **Title** — done-condition. Doc-impact: <`docs/` pages, or none>. [dossier]`

- **Event animations** — when an event's answer lands, what it changes on the map — burned tiles, killed population and units, anything an answer does — is animated rather than simply redrawn; the tile The herd's _Follow it_ charts is one of them, wherever it lies on the map, and nothing draws the eye to it until then.
- **A failed boot says so** — when the game fails to boot, WebGL missing for one, the player sees an error message instead of a blank page with the error only in the console.
- **Merge elevation and river lift** — test if a terrain's elevation and its river lift can be the same data: they only diverge on forest, and both represent the same idea of terrain elevation.
- **Close v0.0.4** — the changelog entry and the tag.
